## About the Project
A **dicho** refers to a colloquialism in Spanish, and a few months ago, I started keeping a list of all the hilarious dichos my mom would say. Let’s be honest, who hasn’t wondered what _'Ponte la de Puebla'_ really means and where it comes from? That’s when it hit me: **I’m not the only one who grew up with these!** So, I decided to turn this idea into something special to share the joy.

Introducing **Dichonario**—a web app built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack to capture and share these gems with the world. The first version is live, featuring 20 of my favorites to get us started. I went with 'Latin American colloquialisms' because I know some of these are used by others, not just Mexicans. I’m excited to include dichos from all of Latinoamérica, making this a true celebration of our vibrant cultures. Who knows, this collection might even inspire an etymology study someday!

I’m already working on new features, like authentication and comments, so we can all sign in, share stories, and debate the "right" way to say things (because, of course, there’s always a debate).

Looking forward to all of your submissions. ¡Gracias!

_Note_: The backend is hosted on Render's free tier, which spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity. It may take up to a minute to start back up and view the dichos when you visit the site.
